The bot is able to quote from 14 translated tafaseer (commentaries on the Qurʾān) for use with the `-tafsir` command. I have attempted to add a short description to each one:

#English :
1. `maarifulquran` (default) - the tafsir of the Pakistani scholar Muhammad Shafi Deobandi (d. 1976 CE).
2. `mukhtasar` - I was unable to find details on this (presumably translated) tafsir.
3. `jalalayn` - the tafsir of the "Two Jalals" - a commentary written by Jalāl ad-Dīn al-Maḥalli and his student Jalāl ad-Dīn as-Suyūtī. It is known for his brevity and concision. This is the default tafsir.
4. `ibnkathir` - the tafsir of Ibn Kathir (d. 774 AH) entitled al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓeem, or more simply, Tafsir Ibn Kathir, is a popular commentary on the Qurʾān based on Ibn Taymiyyah's exegetical style of quoting early Muslim authorities (the salaf).
